#Figuring out basic web development in 2020
Found this theme called Mediator which looked basic yet gorgeous. Figured out that just forking the repository and updating the config.yml file with appropriate repository link is all that it takes to setup the basic static page.

Setup Git Desktop so that images and a local development environment was setup. Did all the jekyll local setup, but to date never used it on a local host. Just pushing the changes to origin and previewing on the git page itself. The changes do take some time to reflect, but not a major deal breaker.

Today I decided to look under the theme and figure out how the webpage works. The first new thing I identified was Shema.org. Since the webpage was a bit hard to digest I decided to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQeRA-Ojq5c"> this video</a>

However nothing good came from watching that video.
So I decided to focus on what I need. I needed a navigation menu bar so that I can classify the content that I'm posting in this page. So I jumped to another <a href="https://youtu.be/35lZBO3XeDQ"> video</a>
